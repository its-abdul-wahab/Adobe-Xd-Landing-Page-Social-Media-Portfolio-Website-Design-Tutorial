In this video we will design a colorful landing page for a social media portfolio with facebook integration and Adobe XD. Adobe XD is a design & prototype tool that we will be using to create this design. Each section of our website will use subtle colors to enhance that section and give a visual representation of each heading and element on the page. Enjoy :D
